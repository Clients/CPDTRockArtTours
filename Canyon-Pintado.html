          <p>Canyon Pintado is listed on the <a href="" target="_blank">National Register of Historic Places</a> and is located in northwest 
          Colorado in the Douglas Valley south of Rangely. Canyon Pintado (Painted Canyon) has been occupied by prehistoric people for
          as long as 11,000 years and was repeatedly visited by a variety of cultures throughout its long history. One culture that left
          a visible mark on the Canyon was the Fremont. The Canyon provides the largest concentration of Fremont archaeological sites along
          the Dinosaur Diamond. More than fifty archaeological sites in the Canyon Pintado District were the handiwork of Fremont-age peoples.
          The Canyon Pintado Historic District features eight marked sites along Highway 139 south of Rangely. The sites feature petroglyphs
          and pictographs on the sheer sandstone walls that were left by Fremont and Ute civilizations long before Europeans explored the
          West.</p>
